# =============================================================================
# IssueLinker - Build & Test Workflow
# =============================================================================
#
# What this workflow does:
#   - Spotless code format check
#   - Run unit tests
#   - Build plugin
#   - Upload build artifact
#
# What this workflow does NOT do:
#   - Auto-deploy to JetBrains Marketplace
#   - Auto-create GitHub Release
#   - Plugin signing
#
# Manual deployment:
#   1. Create and push release/v1.0.0 branch
#   2. Wait for CI build to pass
#   3. Download zip from GitHub Actions → Artifacts
#   4. Upload manually to JetBrains Marketplace
#      https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/add
